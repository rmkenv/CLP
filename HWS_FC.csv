Randolph wanted to establish a successful city near Casa Grande. On July 18, 1925, the Randolph Post Office opened, with Channing E. Babbitt as its postmaster. With the increased need for agricultural workers which arose in the late 1920s, hundreds of farm workers migrated to the area in the 1930s. Many of those who settled in Randolph were black migrants from Oklahoma. This influx created a community which was predominantly black. The post office closed in 1983.","https://kids.kiddle.co/Randolph,_Arizona",Images: https://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/digital/collection/histphotos/id/34619/
